Find the distance and relative direction to the enemy in a HEX-grid.
</p>

<p>
HEX-grid (hexagonal grid) is a coordinate system, like square grid. To find distance
between two cells you don't need to find exact path from one to another, but 
correctly work with their coordinates.
Another approach to calculate distance is
to notice that all cells strict around your cell form a kind of circle and are on
distance 1 from your cell, the cells around all previous cells (next "circle") are
on distance 2 etc.
In this mission the field from "A1" to "Z9" is used for placing you
and enemy, but you may need to use coordinates "outside" this field for your calculations.
Be attentive to cases when your position is on the edge of the field.

<p>Absolute Directions. If we take any cell, the cell above it is always to the
    north ("N"), below - to the south ("S") etc.
</p>

<p>

         alt="Directions"
         style="max-height: 159px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Relative Directions depends of your absolute direction. if your absolute direction is "N",
    relative directions are the following. So all cells around specific cell form
    4 "sectors": forward, right, back and left. Cells considered as present in this
    sectors, even if they are "outside" of our field.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="{{MEDIA}}relative_directions.png"
         alt="Relative Directions"
         style="max-height: 245px"/>
</p>

<p>
    But when your absolute direction is for example "SE" these "sectors" rotate and the cell
    in front of your cell will be to the south-east, and the north absolute
    direction will be in left sector.

<p><strong>Input:</strong>Three arguments: your current coordinates, your current absolute directions, and enemy's coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong>{% if is_js %}An array{% else %}A list{% endif %} with relative direction and distance to the enemy.</p>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: {% if is_js %}javascript{% else %}python{% endif %}">{% if is_js %}findEnemy{% else %}find_enemy{% endif %}('B2', 'S', 'B4') == ['F', 2]</pre>
</div>

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    <p>War-game design uses hex-grid.</p>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Preconditions:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>'A1' &le; coordinates &le; 'Z9';</li>
        <li>direction in ('N', 'NE', 'SE', 'S', 'SW', 'NW');</li>
        <li>your coordinates &ne; enemy's coordinates.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
